            <p><strong>Wellspring RPG</strong>. A mangawave tabletop RPG about exploring a dangerous world with your friends.</p>

            <p>In <strong>Wellspring</strong>, players take the stage as <strong>travelers</strong> â€” explorers, traders, and battle heroes who are all trying to carve out a life on a dangerous planet. Some will journey through the most hazardous depths to save those lost within the Gloom, some will mine it for mysterious treasures from ages long lost to catastrophes. Others will aim to find the source of the Gloom; clearing the lands from its miasma before it overtakes civilization itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Wellspring RPG</strong> offers a scene-focused journey system that plays out in chapters, and tactical combat <strong>(coming soon!)</strong> with deep customization. In <strong>Wellspring</strong>, your table can tell the stories you love.</p>

            <p>The setting features inspiration from the dying earth genre, old and current famous manga, and future funk/glitch/vaporwave aesthetics.</p> 

            <p>It is recommended, and best played with a group of <strong>3-5 players</strong> for both one-offs and long-form campaigns.</p>

            <p>Take the <strong>dive</strong>. Tell us what you find deep within.</p>

            <p>Wellspring RPG is currently in Alpha. Hop in the pit with us.</p>
